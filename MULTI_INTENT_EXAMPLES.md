# Multi-Intent Query Handling

## 🎯 The Problem We Solved

Some queries need **BOTH** metadata **AND** code analysis:
- "How many files are there and how are they connected?"
- "List all Ruby files and explain the main one"
- "Count API endpoints and show me the authentication endpoint"

## ✅ How RepoCoder Handles This Now

### Example 1: "How many files are there and how are they connected?"

```
STEP 1.5: QUERY ROUTING
→ Multi-intent query detected: ['metadata', 'code']
✓ Multi-intent routing: metadata, code
  Strategy: multi_intent
  Needs Code: True
  Needs Metadata: True

STEP 2: CONTEXT RETRIEVAL
→ Multi-intent query - gathering both metadata and code
✓ Added metadata context
→ Semantic retrieval for code connections

STEP 4: RESPONSE GENERATION
→ Building prompt with BOTH metadata AND code
```

**Prompt sent to model:**
```
Task: How many files are there and how are they connected?

Repository Information:
- Total Files: 245
- Code Files: 245
- Languages: Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Sample Files: deploy.rb, Gemfile, config.ru, ...

Code Context (15 relevant chunks):
📁 deploy.rb
[code showing file relationships]

📁 Gemfile
[code showing dependencies]

Provide your analysis in JSON format.
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "analysis": "The project has 245 files across 4 languages. These files are connected through:\n1. Ruby requires/imports\n2. Gemfile dependencies\n3. Capistrano tasks\n4. HTML includes and assets",
  "plan": "File connections analysis based on imports and dependencies"
}
```

### Example 2: "List all Ruby files and explain deploy.rb"

```
STEP 1.5: QUERY ROUTING
→ Multi-intent query detected: ['metadata', 'code']
→ File reference: deploy.rb
  Strategy: multi_intent
  Needs Both: True
```

**Prompt:**
```
Task: List all Ruby files and explain deploy.rb

Repository Information:
- Ruby files: deploy.rb, config.ru, Gemfile, ...
- Total: 15 Ruby files

Code Context (1 chunk from deploy.rb):
📁 deploy.rb
[full deploy.rb content]

Provide your analysis in JSON format.
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "analysis": "Ruby files in project:\n1. deploy.rb - Capistrano deployment\n2. config.ru - Rack config\n...\n\nThe deploy.rb file uses Capistrano to...",
  "plan": "Listed Ruby files and explained deploy.rb functionality"
}
```

### Example 3: "Count API endpoints and explain the authentication one"

```
STEP 1.5: QUERY ROUTING
→ Multi-intent query detected: ['metadata', 'code']
  Strategy: multi_intent
```

**Prompt:**
```
Task: Count API endpoints and explain the authentication one

Repository Information:
- Total Files: 245
- Code Files: 245

Code Context (20 chunks with "API" and "authentication"):
📁 api_controller.rb
[API endpoint definitions]

📁 auth_controller.rb
[Authentication endpoint code]

Provide your analysis in JSON format.
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "analysis": "Found 12 API endpoints in the codebase:\n- /api/auth (authentication)\n- /api/users\n- /api/data\n...\n\nThe authentication endpoint (/api/auth) works by...",
  "plan": "Counted all endpoints and explained authentication"
}
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Detection
```python
# MultiIntentHandler detects "and" or "also"
query = "How many files and how are they connected?"
         ↓
detected: ["how many files"] → metadata
          ["how are they connected"] → code
         ↓
is_multi_intent = True
intents = ['metadata', 'code']
```

### Routing Decision
```python
{
  "strategy": "multi_intent",
  "sub_strategies": ["metadata", "code"],
  "needs_code": True,
  "needs_metadata": True,
  "can_compute_directly": False,  # Need LLM to combine
  "reasoning": "Multi-intent query combining: metadata, code"
}
```

### Context Building
```python
# 1. Get metadata
metadata = "Total Files: 245, Languages: Ruby, ..."

# 2. Get code chunks
chunks = retrieve_semantic("how are files connected", top_k=20)

# 3. Combine both
prompt = f"""
Repository Information:
{metadata}

Code Context:
{chunks}

Task: {original_query}
"""
```

### LLM Processing
The model sees **BOTH** metadata and code, can answer both parts!

## 📊 Query Types Handled

### Single Intent (Works as before)
```bash
✓ "How many files?" → metadata only
✓ "How does deploy.rb work?" → file_specific only
✓ "Explain authentication" → semantic only
```

### Multi-Intent (NEW!)
```bash
✓ "How many files and how are they connected?" → metadata + code
✓ "List Ruby files and explain the main one" → metadata + code
✓ "Count endpoints and show authentication" → metadata + code
✓ "What languages are used and show example code" → metadata + code
```

## 🎯 Examples to Test

```bash
# Multi-intent: count + explain
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "How many files are there and how are they organized?",
    "top_k": 20
  }'

# Multi-intent: list + analyze
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "List all Ruby files and explain what deploy.rb does",
    "top_k": 25
  }'

# Multi-intent: count + show
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Count deployment tasks and show the restart task",
    "top_k": 20
  }'

# Multi-intent: what + how
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "What technologies are used and how do they work together?",
    "top_k": 30
  }'
```

## 📈 Performance

### Single Intent Queries
- Metadata: <100ms (direct)
- File-specific: ~2s (LLM)
- Semantic: ~3s (LLM)

### Multi-Intent Queries
- Metadata + Code: ~3-4s (metadata is instant, code needs LLM)
- Structure + Code: ~4-5s (both need processing)

**Still very fast!** ⚡
